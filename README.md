## Introduction

Real estate investors often require a catalogue of tools to help determine the value of a property. This project adopts an analytical aproach to such problems by using a regression model to consider multiple determining factors at once.

The project was conducted in partial fulfillment of the conditions to complete the Statistics with R specialization on Coursera from Duke University. A more accessible version of the complete project can be read [here](https://rpubs.com/SheyLontum/684069)
